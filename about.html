    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    
    <p>
      Gitimbine United Methodist Church began in 2008 with just 30 devoted members, meeting in a modest restaurant behind an office. Though the space was simple, the spirit was strong. In 2017, the church relocated to Kwa Ndhambi, a few meters before Backstreet, marking a new chapter of growth. Today, we are blessed with over 150 members who gather in faith, fellowship, and service.
