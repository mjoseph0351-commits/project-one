                <h2>Lets talk about the Deaf Ministry</h2>
                <P> 
                    The Gitimbine United Methodist Church, situated in Meru town- kenya, has always been committed to serving its community inclusively and compassionately. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals participating in church activities and within the broader community. Recognizing the importance of accessible spiritual ministry for all members, the church embarked on a journey to establish a dedicated Deaf Ministry‚Äîaimed at fostering inclusivity, spiritual growth, and active participation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in church life.

                <h2>What about its origin</h2>
                <h3>What about our motivation</h3>
                <p>The idea to start a Deaf Ministry was initiated by Joel, a dedicated member of the congregation, at the beginning of 2025. Joel‚Äôs passion for inclusivity and his awareness of the challenges faced by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in accessing spiritual resources motivated him to propose this initiative. His desire was rooted in the belief that everyone deserves an opportunity to experience God‚Äôs love and community regardless of their hearing ability.

                <h2> Discussion and planning</h2>
                <P> 
                    Following Joel‚Äôs proposal, the idea was brought to the attention of the church leadership and the church council. The council members recognized the significance of the initiative, especially given the increasing population of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the church and surrounding community. A series of discussions and planning sessions ensued, involving stakeholders such as church leaders, members of the congregation, and individuals from the deaf community to understand their specific needs and expectations.
                </P>
                <p>
                    These deliberations focused on the development of a comprehensive plan that would include sign language interpretation, deaf-friendly communication strategies, outreach programs, and training for church volunteers and staff. The goal was to ensure that the ministry would be sustainable, impactful, and truly inclusive.

                <h2>Approval and Formal Establishment</h2>
                <p>
                    After thorough evaluation and strategic planning, the church council officially approved the establishment of the Deaf Ministry in April 2025. This approval marked a significant milestone, demonstrating the church‚Äôs commitment to inclusivity and social justice. The ministry was tasked with creating programs that would foster spiritual growth, community building, and advocacy for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

                <h2>Lets start</h2>
                <p>In the year 1989, "A burden was laid by the Lord in my heart for the young people". The burden had become heavier as I see the addiction of drugs, alcoholism, misery caused to parents and the spiritual need of the young people. Through fervent prayer a vision was given to reach out to young people, particularly in the North Eastern region of India with a message of Salvation through Christ. However, it took 18 years to establish Youth Harvest Ministry on 18th August 2009, as an independent faith-based ministry.</p>
                <p>God the Holy Spirit has inspired the name of the ministry as YOUTH HARVEST MINISTRY based on the promised word of God, John 4: 35-36 "...see how they are already white for the Harvest‚Ä¶, for he is gathering fruit unto eternal life". The voice was clear from the Lord, as me and my wife were fasting and waiting on the Lord, "Disciple my Children, whom I harvest them. Teach them to follow me, equip them to witness me and to live an overcoming, abundant life".</p>
                <p>Since the voice continued to speak into my heart for the last four years, with much prayer and assurance from the Lord, harvest LEADERSHIP and DISCIPLESHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE was born under the umbrella of Youth Harvest Ministry.</p>
                <p>As the name clearly suggests, it will help, train and equip young people to live life to the fullness and to continue walking with the Lord without backsliding.</p>
