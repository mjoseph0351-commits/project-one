        first:
            lets make the left side bar be something collapsable.
            Then let it fit on the screen, every word should be properly visible.
        Second:
            There is alot of style css of the side bar, hence there is a high possibility of conflict. So the actual cod might be something that is elaborate, And the sentences that that I need to use have to be straight clear and precise, something that accounts for the html, css and java, and something that covers anything that might bring conflict in the css
        Third for the collapsed side bar, 
           
           Forth, lets look at that collapsed side bar, It has a black under lay
